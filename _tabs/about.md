**Junior Penetration Tester \| Aspiring Red Teamer**





I specialize in network and Active Directory penetration testing, with a deep focus on post-exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. My experience spans web, network, Android, and AD security, but I am most passionate about navigating the complexities of enterprise networks and performing threat emulation.

Driven by a relentless curiosity and a hacker mindset, I constantly push my limits to refine offensive security techniques. My goal is to master adversary tradecraft and evolve into a skilled Red Teamer, staying ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
